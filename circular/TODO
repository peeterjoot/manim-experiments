- GADecoding:
   - Add mini GA intro (e_i^2 = 1, e_1 e_2 = - e_2 e_1)
   - show better: thetahat = rhat i = e_2 e^{i\theta}
   - reverse the logic to assemble the GA exponential form.
- GAIntroRot90_27
   - animation rotation of vector by right multiplication with i
- Finale: add a subscribe popup.

- script the remainder.  Trial recordings with additional delays.
