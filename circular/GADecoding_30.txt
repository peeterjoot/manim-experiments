A geometric algebra is a vector space with scalar, vector and product-of-vector elements, subject to an additional constraint,
the contraction axiom:

The square of a vector is the dot product of that vector with itself.

#dimensional geometric algebra can be understood completely is a particularly simple geomet

#by applying a complex exponentials to e1 and e2 respectively,
#where i is ordered product of e1 e2, a bivector that squares to -1.
