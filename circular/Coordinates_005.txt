Circular coordinates parameterize points in the plane using an angle and radial length.

Keeping the radius fixed, and varying the angle, we trace out circular arcs.

Keeping the angle fixed, and varying the radius, we trace out lines radiating outward from the origin.

Varying both simultaneously allows us to trace out arbitrary paths.
