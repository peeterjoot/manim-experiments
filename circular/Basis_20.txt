In a circular coordinate system, a basis vector is defined at each point along a circular arc.

These basis vectors are rotations of the standard basis vectors.

The unit radial vector r-hat is a rotation of the e_1 basis vector.

Similarly, the theta-hat vector is the rotation of the e_2 basis vector.


# redo from here:
#Algebraically, we can describe these rotations using geometric algebra by applying a complex exponentials to e1 and e2 respectively,
where i is ordered product of e1 e2, a bivector that squares to -1.
