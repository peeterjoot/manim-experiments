Now let's compute the derivative of the tangential unit vector.

As before,
imagine that this vector at an initial position, and displace the angle by Delta theta.

Zooming in on the difference, we see that the radial unit vector derivative is inwards radially oriented.

We can compute this derivative easily from our exponential representation.

Again, the time dependence is implicit, through the angle theta.  Using chain rule, we bring down a factor of
i \theta'.

We have to be careful not to commute i, the pseudoscalar for the plane, with any vector factors.

We are left with

   - omega-rhat,

where, again, omega is the angular frequency, dtheta/dt.
