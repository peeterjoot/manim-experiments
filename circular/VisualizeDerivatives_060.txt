We will now compute the derivative of the radial unit vector.

Geometrically, imagine that we have such a vector at an initial position, and displace the angle by Delta theta.

Zooming in on the difference, we see that the radial unit vector derivative is tangentially oriented.

We can compute this derivative easily, from our exponential representation.

The time dependence is all implicit, through the angle theta.  Using chain rule, we bring down a factor of
i \theta'.

We have to be careful not to commute i, the pseudoscalar for the plane, with any vector factors.

We recognize that the 'r-hat i' vector is theta-hat, leaving us with:

   rhat prime equals omega-thetahat,

where omega, our angular frequency, is dtheta/dt.
