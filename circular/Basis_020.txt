In a circular coordinate system, a basis vector is defined at each point along a circular arc.
These basis vectors are rotations of the standard basis vectors.

The unit radial vector r-hat is a rotation of the e_1 basis vector.

The theta-hat vector is the rotation of the e_2 basis vector.

Let's zoom in on these vectors so that we can describe them algebraically.

With the radial unit vector (r-hat) at an angle theta from the horizontal, then it is clear that it equals e_1 cos theta + e_2 sin theta.

Similarily, the tangential unit vector (theta-hat) is at an angle theta from the vertical, so it equals -e_1 sin theta + e_2 cos theta.

We could work with this trigonometric form for the circular unit vectors, but will opt instead to describe these
rotated frame vectors using geometric algebra.
