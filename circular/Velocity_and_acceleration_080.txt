our position vector is r rhat, so the velocity is a chain rule expansion, where
 we take derivatives of r and rhat in turn.

We've computed rhat-prime, which is just omega-thetahat.


We can compute the acceleration in the same fashion, but it's easier to stick with r-hat',
 and then take the second derivatives.

Now we plug in rhat',
 and expand the omega thetahat derivative.

We can now plug in thetahat'

and regroup, finding the radial and tangential components of the acceleration.

Finally, assuming we don't care about r = 0, we tidy up the thetahat component of the acceleration slightly.
