We now know enough to express our unit radial and tangential vectors in complex exponential form.

Starting with the radial unit vector, we introduce a factor of
 one = e1 e1 on the sine term.

We can now factor out the leading e1, leaving an e1 e2 factor for the sine.

Assuming knowledge of complex algebra, we write e1 e2 as i, recovering the familar
 cos + i sine.  The usual argument for expressing cos + i sine as e^i-theta
 uses the Taylor series for exp, sine, and cosine, which only requires that i^2 = -1.
 For this reason, we are free to form a bivector-valued "complex exponential".

We can do the same thing for the thetacap vector, this time introducing a factor of
 one as e2-squared.

We can now factor out the leading e2, and then use the anticommutative property, to
 find another cos + i sine.  This gives us an exponential representation for both
 r-hat and theta-hat.

We should also be able to show that thetacap = rhat i.  Let's expand that.
 We may commute i with the complex exponential, and then expand the remaining
 e1 i product, which is e2.  Sure enough, as expected, we find the complex exponential
 form of theta-cap.

We can think of r-hat and theta-hat as rotations of the original e1,e2 frame, as we
 traverse a circle.
