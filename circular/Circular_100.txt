It shouldn't be a suprise that an important special case velocity and acceleration in circular coordinates
 is motion that is constrained to a circle.

For circular motion, where the radius is fixed, all the r' derivatives are zero, so our
 velocity and acceleration formulas are considerably simplified.

We see that the velocity is neccessarily and completely tangential to the circular path.
The acceleration always has an inward facing component, the centripedial component
 of the acceleration,
 but only has a tangential component if the angular frequency varies with time.

Here is a plot of velocity and acceleration for angular frequency with a line time dependency.

For circular motion with constant angular frequency, the acceleration is strictly directed
 inwards to the origin, as shown in the plot to the left.

You have probably encountered equations for this type of motion in scalar form.
