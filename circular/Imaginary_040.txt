Here's a summary of the unit vector properties that we've found for a two dimensional geometric algebra.

- Both unit vectors square to one: e1^2 = e2^2 = 1
- The product of perpendicular unit vectors is anticommutative.

Any 2 dimensional bivector is proportional to e1 e2.  We use this bivector as the
basis bivector for a two dimensional geometric algebra,

and designate it as i, like the imaginary i of complex numbers, since it happens to also
square to minus one.

To show this, we write out the square

i^2 = e1 e2 e1 e2.

Using the anticommutation property that we just found, we can flip the order 
any vectors, such as the first, provided we changing the sign as we do so.

Group the two adjacent e1 products, eliminates them, since e1^2 equals one.

We are left with minus e2 squared, but e2 squared is one.
  We find, perhaps without suprise, that the square of our unit bivector i is minus one.

Now let's look at products of vectors with i.
We need to be careful with order, since i commutes scalars and bivectors, but not with vectors.
In this video, we will keep vectors on the left in any vector-multivector products.

Expanding e_1 i, we have an e1-squared product, which is one, leaving e2.

Expanding e_2 i, we can use the anticommutation property, to write i as -e2 e1.
Grouping e2 factors, we are left with -e1.

We've just seen that right multiplication of e1 with i rotates it by 90 degrees towards e2,
and that right multiplication of e2 with i also rotates another 90 degrees.

We can conclude, by superposition, that right multiplication of any vector with i rotates positively by 90 degrees in the plane.
