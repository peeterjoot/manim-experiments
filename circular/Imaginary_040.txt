In 2D any bivector is proportional to e1 e2.

Let's look at the properties of this important bivector, which we will designate as i.

First, we compute i-squared.

Written out explicitly, i^2 is e1 e2 e1 e2.

Using the anticommutation property that we just found, we can flip the order of the
first two vectors, changing the sign as we do so.

We can opt to compute these products in whatever order we like, so we group the two adjacent e1 products, which is one.

We are left with minus e1 squared, but e1 squared is one, so we find that the square of our unit bivector i is minus one.

Now let's look at products of vectors with i.
We need to be careful with order, since i commutes scalars and bivectors, but not with vectors.
In this video, we will keep vectors on the left in any vector-multivector products.

Expanding e_1 i, we have an e1-squared product, which is one, leaving e2.

Expanding e_2 i, we can use the anticommutation property, to write i as -e2 e1.
Grouping e2 factors, we are left with -e1.

We've just seen that right multiplication of e1 with i rotates it by 90 degrees towards e2,
and that right multiplication of e2 with i also rotates another 90 degrees.

By superposition, it is generally true that right multiplication of any vector with i rotates it positively by 90 degrees.
