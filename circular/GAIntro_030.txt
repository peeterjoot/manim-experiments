A geometric algebra is a vector space where the elements are sums of scalars, vectors, and products of vectors (called multivectors), subject to a rule (called the contraction axiom) for the square of a vector

   The square of a vector, is the dot product of that vector with itself.

In words, this says that the square of a vector is the squared length of a vector.

Let's apply the contraction axiom to each of the vectors in the following right triangle.

We have unit vectors on the horizontal and vertical sides of the triangle, so we can
 immediately state that

 e1^2 = 1

and

 e2^2 = 1

The squared length of the diagonal vector, e1 + e2, is 2.  Let's flip this around and
expand this square, taking care to maintain product order.

We have the sum of squares of two unit vectors, which is 2.  We find immediately that the contraction axiom implies that the product of perpendicular unit vectors anticommutes.  A product of two perpendicular vectors is called a bivector.

In a few seconds, we've extracted the most fundamental relationships for a two dimensional geometrical algebra, namely:

   e1^2 = e2^2 = 1

and

   e2 e1 = - e1 e2
