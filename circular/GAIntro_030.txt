The simplest geometric algebra, is that of the Euclidean plane, with unit vectors
 e1, e2, both perpendicular.

The contraction axiom implies that

 e1^2 = 1

and

 e2^2 = 1

Let's apply the contraction axiom to the diagonal of the right triangle with sides e1,e2.

The squared length of the diagonal vector, e1 + e2, is 2, so
2 = (e1 +e2)^2
Let's expand this square, taking care to maintain product order.

We have the sum of squares of two unit vectors, which is 2.  We find immediately that the contraction axiom implies that the product of perpendicular unit vectors anticommutes.  
A product of two perpendicular vectors is called a bivector.

#All bivectors in a 2D geometric algebra are proportional to e1 e2, which we designate as i.
