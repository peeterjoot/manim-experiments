Let's look at an example of a vector traceing out all the positions along a continuous curve.

rhat neccessarily points towards the point on the path, and
the velocity is always tangent to the curve, but may have both rhat and thetahat components at all points
along the path.

In general, for an arbitrary parameterized path,
both the velocity and acceleration vectors have radial and tangential components, with just the right combination of those
rhat and thetahat components so that the velocity lies always tangent to the curve.
