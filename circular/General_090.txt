Let's look at an example of a vector tracing out all the positions along a continuous curve.

In general, for an arbitrary parameterized path,
 both the velocity and acceleration vectors have rhat and thetahat components.

For the velocity, we have just the right superposition of 
 rhat and thetahat components for the velocity to always lie tangent to the curve.
