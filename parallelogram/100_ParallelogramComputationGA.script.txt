With a geometric algebra formulation of the rejection operator, we can return to the parallelogram area computation, and 
 see if we can gain any additional insight.

As before, our area computation is base times height, and we compute the squared area to avoid square roots.

Picking the base as the length of u, our squared height is the rejection squared.
 We write that product as the rejection times it's reverse, since reversing all the factors in a multivector 
  leaves the vector (and scalar) components invariant.
 We are free to commute the u-squared term (a scalar), after which we may cancel all the non-wedge product u-terms.
 Flipping the order of one of the wedges, we find that the area of the parallelogram formed by u and v,
 is the (negative) square of the wedge product of those two vectors.

This looks a little different from the result that we found previously, so let's show that they are actually the same.
 Expanding the square by dotting it with itself, we can use the distributive identity, and then expand the dot products 
 from the inside out.
 Plugging this into our squared area expression above, we find that the negative squared wedge expands into the same
 product of squares minus square of dots expression that we found before.

We actually loose expressiveness by performing this expansion, as it is no longer clear that this has anything to do with the
 squared wedge.
 In the end, we will identify the wedge product itself as representation of a signed area element, but we are not quite there
 yet.
