If we know a-priori that the bivector u-wedge-v for the plane rotates any vector in the plane by 90 degrees,
 then it is obvious geometrically that the projection and rejection are perpendicular.

We can show this is the case algebraically by dotting the two, expressing the dot product as the scalar grade selection of the product of the two.
