* (audio) Script things.
* Put in appropriate delays.
* Expand the wedge as a sum of bivector determinant scaled unit vectors.
* Expand || u ^ v ||^2 in terms of determinants.
* Add DrawVectorsAndProjRej: add into ProjRej (no labels until end)
* Geometry of rejection: show area of rej * ucap and show how ucap is rotated and scaled to the length of rej by the bivector rej \wedge ucap.

nice to have:
=============
* Add colors
* Switch to xcolor from set_color and color transformer (too painful to get right.)
