4) (audio) Script things.
5) Put in appropriate delays.
7) Some sort of conclusion.
8) rejection in 3D VA:

ucap \cross (\ucap \cross v)

9) wedge product structure of determinant:

show how the right basis choice reduces the wedge to:

\vmatrix{ a & 0 \\ 0 & b } \Be_1 \Be_2 = a b \Be_1 \Be_2

Illustrate this in 3D as an animation, changing parallelogram to a rectange, and finally a square.

Then, since

Area^2 = \lr{ \vmatrix{ a & 0 \\ 0 & b } }^2  = \norm{ a \wedge b }^2

We can say that 
a \wedge b = \pm Area e_1 e_2

(with that basis choice.)

10) Probably want a summary that relates any GA formulas to their VA equivalents.

nice to have:
=============
* Add colors
* Switch to xcolor from set_color and color transformer (too painful to get right.)
   Q: what are the color codes for YELLOW, RED, ... and how do those map to xcolor definitions?  Can probably introduce .sty for color definitions if req'd.]
