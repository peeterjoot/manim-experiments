4) (audio) Script things.
5) Put in appropriate delays.
7) Some sort of conclusion.
8) rejection in 3D VA:

ucap \cross (\ucap \cross v)

10) Probably want a summary that relates any GA formulas to their VA equivalents.

11) restore 17s of delay to:

    030_DrawParallelogram.py

12) review all delays after color rework.

13) 130_BivectorAddition.py: has a weird transform of colored vectors to non-colored.  do that differently.  Also: fade in the grid.

14) start the intro rotation at about the 1s viewpoint so the purple parallelogram isn't seen edge on.
