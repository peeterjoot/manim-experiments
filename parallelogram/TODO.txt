*) rough script for all of:

   140_ScalarMultiplicationSign.script.txt
   150_Finale.script.txt

*) draft recording of each of:

   070_ProjRejPerp.script.txt
   080_RejIsVector.script.txt
   100_ParallelogramComputationGA.script.txt
   110_WedgeToDet.script.txt
   120_WedgeR3.script.txt
   130_BivectorAddition.script.txt

*) adjust scripts to match what I want in the recordings.

*) Put in appropriate delays.  Will have to adjust some of the previous ones, as I've changes things (esp. color rework.)

*) "final recording" for each segment.

*) Some sort of conclusion.

*) Probably want a summary that relates any GA formulas to their VA equivalents.

*) restore 17s of delay to:

    030_DrawParallelogram.py

*) start the intro rotation at about the 1s viewpoint so the purple parallelogram isn't seen edge on.

*) 120: recast the rejection in cross product form. i.e.: ucap \cross (\ucap \cross v)

*) 130: FIXME: Boundaries aren't explained well.  This needs to be illustrated better.

   There's an attempt to do that in 140, but it's out of sequence.

*) Remove sudgy from finale -- splitting first video into one on just projection and rejection.
