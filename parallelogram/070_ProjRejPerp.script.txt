If we know a-priori that the bivector u-wedge-v for the plane rotates any vector in the plane by 90 degrees,
 then it is obvious geometrically that the projection and rejection are perpendicular.

The product of two vectors can be expressed as the sum of the dot and wedge products of those vectors.
 Equivalently, the product of two vectors can be expressed as the grade-0 and grade-2 components of that product,
 which are designated with angle brackets.

 This equivalence allows us to write the dot product as the scalar grade (grade 0) selection of the product of two vectors,
 and write the wedge product as the grade-2 selection of the product of two vectors.

We use scalar grade selection to compute the dot product of the rejection and projection.

We can pull the dot product, as it is a scalar, right out of the grade selection operator.

That leaves us with the product of the two u-inverses, which is also a scalar, and can be pulled out.

We are left selecting the grade-zero portion of a wedge product, which is grade two, so the dot product is zero.

We have verified algebraically that the projection and rejection expressions we have found are perpendicuar, as expected.
