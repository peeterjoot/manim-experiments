Having expanded the wedge product in coordinates, we encountered something that has a structure very much cross product like.

Here we will see exactly how the two are related.

Our sum runs over all pairs of indexes i < j, which are 12, 13, 23.

Looking at each of the summands term by term,
 - starting with 12, we are free to multiply by one, in the form of e3 squared.
   Regrouping, we find that the 12 term can be expressed as the product of the R3 pseudoscalar (called I here),
   and e3.
 - For the 13 term, we can insert a 1 = e2-squared between the e1 and e3 vectors.  We can then permute the last two
   terms, toggling the sign.  This leaves us with -I e2.
 - Finally, for the 23 term, we pre-multiply by 1 = e1-squared, and regroup.  We are left with e1 I.

Plugging back into the sum we have all our determinants, each one multiplied by a pseudoscalar-vector product.  The R3
 pseudoscalar commutes with all grades, so we can factor it out.

 Looking closely, we can recognize the vector factor as the cross product, expecially if we put it into the 3x3 determant form.
 We find that the R3 wedge product is a pseudoscalar scaled cross product.
 Recall that the cross product of two vectors is a vector that has the area of the parallelogram spanned by those two vectors, but
 lies normal two the plane that they lie in.
 Multiplication of such a normal vector by the pseudoscalar maps that normal vector into a bivector that we can
  say represents the plane itself.  We'll justify this claim and interpretation further as we go on.

 Before we leave this R3 case, we can make a final note of how the squared-area is related to both the cross and wedge products.
