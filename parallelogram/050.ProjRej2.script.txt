To summarize,
 the projection of v onto u is the dot product of v and u, all multiplied by u-inverse,
# 07: +7s
 and the rejection of u from v is the wedge product of v and u, all multiplied by u-inverse.
# 12: +7s

For the multivector products in the rejection operator, order matters,
 but we could equivalently write the rejection as u-inverse times the wedge of u with v.
 To demonstrate that to yourself, try expanding v as u-inverse u v instead, as we just did before.
# 29: +15s

This is the most general form to express the projection and rejection operators, and applies to Euclidean and
 also non-Euclidian spaces (i.e. like the relativistic four-vector spaces that we use in physics.)
 However, for Euclidean spaces (like R3), where any unit vector is it's own inverse, we can write these
 as:
# 45: +16s
 (v dot u-hat) all times u-hat, and
# 50: +6s
 (v wedge u-hat) all times u-hat.
# 54: +4s
