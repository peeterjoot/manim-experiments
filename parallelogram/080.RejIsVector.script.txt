Our decomposition of v into components parallel and perpendicular to u gave us a perfectly normal vector expression for the projection, but a multivector expression for the rejection.

The product of a bivector and a vector, in general has vector and trivector components, but the rejection must be a vector.

Let's see why the trivector term, in this case, is zero.

We first expand the multivector product in terms of its dot and wedge product components.

Since the wedge product is associative, we can opt to wedge the u and u-inverse terms first.
 Because u-inverse is parallel to u, this wedge product is zero.

We are left with a bivector-vector dot product, which is a vector.

Specifically, this vector is v, minus the projection of v on u.
