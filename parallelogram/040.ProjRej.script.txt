The projection of v on u and the rejection of u from v are both illustrated in the figure.
# 0:06   +6s.

Algebraically, we can find expressions for these vectors using a standard trick of mathematics,
 multiplying by one, but using a special form of one.
# 0:14:   +8s.

In this case, our special form of one, is u times it's inverse.
# 0:19:   +5s

By switching the order of multiplication, we expand the product of v and u,
 replacing that product with it's dot and wedge components.
# 0:26    +7s


Finally, we distribute the u-inverse.
 Recall that u inverse is just u divided by it's square.

 This is a vector that is parallel to u.

 The v-dot-u term lies in the direction of u,
  since u and u-inverse are parallel.

 On the other hand, the v-wedge-u term lies perpendicular to u,
  since v-wedge-u times u-inverse,
  rotates u-inverse by 90 degrees from u towards v.
# 0:49    +23s -- need more animation here.


We have blundered upon a decomposition of v, into components that are directed parallel and perpendicular to u.
 These must neccessarily be the components of v that we have labelled the projection and rejection.
