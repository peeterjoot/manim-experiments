We've seen that the square of a wedge product of two vectors is related to the squared area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors.
 What can we say about the (unsquared) wedge product?
 To attempt to gain some insight into that question, let's expand the wedge of two vectors in coordinates.  

We'll use u_i and v_i as the coordinates of these vectors with respect to an othonormal basis e_i.
 When expanding the wedge, where we are summing over two sets of coordinates, 
 we switch the dummy index in one of these sums, so we can sum over all ij pairs.
 In this double sum, the coordinates can all be factored out.
 Since the wedge of e_i, e_j is zero any time that i equals j, we only need to include the i not-equal j terms in the sum.
 For example, in R^3, this would be the 1,2 2,1 1,3 3,1 and 2,3 3,2 pairs of indexes.
 We can break up these sums into two sets, one with all the indexes for which i < j, and another where i > j.
 Since the indexes are dummy indexes, we can rename them if desired, opting to swap the index names in the second sum,
  after which we have two sums over i < j.
 Because e_i and e_j are perpendicular, we can swap them (with a corresponding toggle of the sign), reducing the sum
  to one term per unique i < j, e_i e_j.
 Each of the scalar coefficients to these unit bivectors is, in fact, a determinant, and
  we can write that out explicitly.

Observe that the determinants highlights the antisymmetry of the wedge product,
 as swapping the u,v's toggles the sign of each determinant, resulting in an overall negation of the product.
