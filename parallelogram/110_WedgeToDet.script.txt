We've seen that we can identify the squared wedge product of two vectors as the squared area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors.
 We'd like to see what we can say about the wedge product itself (not it's square.)
 As a first step to gaining this insight, let's expand such a wedge product in coordinates.

For this coordinate expansion, we will use u_i and v_i as the coordinates with respect to a standard basis with elements e_i.
 We must switch the dummy index for one of these vectors so that we can merge the sums.
 The coordinates can all be factored out of the wedge products.
 Since the wedge of e_i, e_j is zero any time that i equals j, we only need to include the i not-equal j terms in the sum.
 For example, in R^3, this would be the 1,2 2,1 1,3 3,1 and 2,3 3,2 pairs of indexes.
 We can break up these sums into two sets, one with all the indexes for which i < j, and another where i > j.
 Since the indexes are dummy indexes, we can rename them if desired, opting to swap the index names in the second sum,
  after which we have two sums over i < j.
 Because e_i and e_j are perpendicular, we can swap them (with a corresponding toggle of the sign), reducing the sum
  to one term per unique i < j, e_i e_j.
 Each of the scalar coefficients to these unit bivectors is, in fact, a determinant, and
  we can write that out explicitly.

Observe that the determinants highlights the antisymmetry of the wedge product,
 as swapping the u,v's toggles the sign of each determinant, resulting in an overall negation of the product.
