We've seen that we can identify the squared wedge product of two vectors as the squared area of the parallelogram spanned by those vectors.
 We'd like to see what we can say about the wedge product itself (not it's square.)
 As a first step to gaining this insight, let's expand such a wedge product in coordinates.

For this coordinate expansion, we will use u_i and v_i as the coordinates with respect to a standard basis with elements e_i.
 We must switch the dummy index for one of these vectors so that we can merge the sums.
