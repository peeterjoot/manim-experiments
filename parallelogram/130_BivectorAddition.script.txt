We are able to obtain the same bivector value by wedging two vectors for many different sets of vectors.
 We can illustrate this by picking different sets of vectors, of different lengths and orientations,
 that when wedged all produce a value of 4 e1 e2.

 Here's such an example in the first quadrant,
  and the second,
  and the third,
  and the fourth.

We are also able to add multiple wedge products together to construct any desired bivector value.
 For example, to construct a 16 e1 e2 valued-bivector, we can add four 4-e1 e2 valued wedge products.
 Clearly, this process could be repeated in the infinitesimal limit to form a region of any desired shape,
 so provided the boundary has a given orientation, we say that a bivector is a shapeless entity.
