We will by computing the area of a parallelogram first geometrically, and then
  using traditional vector algebra, we compute the area of an n-dimensional parallelogram.

To perform the same computation using geometric algebra (GA), we want projection and rejection operations in our toolbox.
  We derive the GA projection and rejection expressions, and discuss some of the subtlies of those expressions.

We then attack the parallelogram area problem anew,
  and find that parallelogram area is inherently related to the wedge product of two vectors.

Next we will show that the wedge product has a determinant representation,
  and show how the wedge product is related to the 3D cross product, which also has a determinant structure.

We will finish off with a discussion of why we consider the wedge product (or 2-blades) to be a representation of an
  oriented (or signed) area.
