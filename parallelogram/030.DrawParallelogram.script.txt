We construct a parallelogram from two vectors, u and v, by lining them up tail to tail, and then translating a copy of each to the tip of the other.

The area of this parallelogram can be computed by dropping a perpendicular, and multiplying the width of that base by this perpendicular height.  This is illustrated by the dotted area.

This perpendicular, as a vector, can be computed by resolving the vector v into it's projection onto u, and subtracting that from v, a quantity that we call the rejection of u from v, or just the rejection.

The area is then just the length of u (the base), times the length of the rejection (the height).  Squaring the area, and expanding the rejection squared by dotting it with itself yields.

Now group our terms, and distribute the u-length squared, noting that u-hat times length u equals u.

We have now calculated the area of the parallelogram formed by two vectors in an n-dimensional Euclidean space.
