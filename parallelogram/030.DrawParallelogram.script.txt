Given two vectors, u and v, arranged tail to tail,
 we construct a parallelogram
 by translating a copy of each to the tip of the other.

The area of this parallelogram can be computed by dropping a perpendicular from the top onto the base.
 We multiply the width of the base by this perpendicular height.
 This rectangular area is illustrated by the purple rectangle and it's dotted lines, and equals the area of the parallelogram.

This perpendicular, can be expressed as a vector,
 by resolving the vector v into it's projection onto u, and then subtracting that projection from v.
 We call this the rejection of u from v, or just the rejection.
 In terms of u and v, the parallelogram area is the length of u (the base), times the length of the rejection (the height).

 The square of this area simplifies nicely,
 so we compute that instead,
 computing the length squared of the rejection vector by dotting it with itself.

We can distribute the u-length squared, and simplify,
 noting that length-of-u times uhat equals u,
 leaving a nice simple expression for the squared-area of the parallelogram formed by two vectors.
 While this is an intrinsically two dimensional problem, but we have performed the compuation in
 a coordinate free fashion that applies to Euclidean spaces of any dimension.

- sound not very good from my gaming headphones.

Timing may change since original rough voice recording as the script was tweaked.
