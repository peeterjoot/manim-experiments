The action of the GA rejection operator can be visualized in two dimensions.

We decompose 'uhat wedge v', into a unit bivector factor (say i), and a scaling factor.

The actions are:

- First rescale u to unit length, producing uhat.
- Next, multiply uhat with i from the right, to rotate uhat towards v by 90 degrees.
- Finally, rescale the rotated uhat by the length-of-v times sine-theta, to produce the rejection.
