This video was produced using Manim, the python software system developed for 3-blue-1-brown's most awesome channel.

I'd like to thank Sudgy Lacamo,
 who provided me with some key guidance when I was struggling with some elementary Manim concepts.
Please check out his channel and his 'From Zero to Geo' series.

This video is a departure from my usual ad-hoc and casual "chalkboard" style videos.  

If you made it this far, and would prefer more videos of this sort, 
 please add a comment that includes 'More manim please...', and like and subscribe.

If you enjoyed this video, you might be interested in my blog, peeterjoot.com
or in my book 'Geometric Algebra for Electrical Engineers.'  
A free pdf copy of that book and detailed notes for a number of physics courses can be found on my blog.
