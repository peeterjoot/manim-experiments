Manually visualizing the triple cross product form of the rejection operator requires some uncomfortable right hand contortions.

Here is an animation of the cross products that contribute to this rejection computation.

In this animation, the vector u is in red, v is in yellow, and the rejection is in green.

First we scale u down to unit length, finding u-hat directed along u.
The v cross u-hat product is normal to the plane containing u-hat and v, 
 but also scaled by length-of-v times sine theta.

A final cross product rotates that normal back into the plane of u-hat and v, perpendicular to u.
