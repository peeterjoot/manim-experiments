In this video, we will
  discover the GA form for vector projection and rejection, and discuss some of the subtlies of those expressions.

  We utilize the trick of multiplying by a special representation of one.
   This lets us decompose a vector into a projective and rejective component,
   and provides us with multivector expressions for the projection and rejection of one vector with respect to another.
  We will justify the projection and rejection identifications of the decomposition that we find.
  We will show that the rejection multivector expression is a vector (i.e: has no grade-3 component.)
  We will find the R{3} form for rejection in conventional vector algebra, and finally
   summarize everything that we found.
