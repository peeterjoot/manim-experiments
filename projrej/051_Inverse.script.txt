The GA vector inverse is just the vector divided by that vector squared.

We can easily verify that this is a right inverse,
 and similarly, see that it is also a left inverse.

The vector squared is defined (by the contraction axiom) as the dot of the vector with itself.
 In a Euclidean space, this also equals the norm-squared length of that vector.

So, for a Euclidean space,
 we can write u-inverse as u divided by the norm-squared of u, or u-hat divided by the length of u.
 We will use this shortly to cast our projection and rejection operators into the conventional vector algebra
 form.
