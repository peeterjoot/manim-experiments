To compute the geometric algebra vector inverse, we divide that vector by it's square.

This is easily verified by substitution.

The vector squared is defined (by the contraction axiom) as the dot of the vector with itself.
 In a Euclidean space, this also equals the norm-squared length of that vector.

So, for a Euclidean space,
 we can write u-inverse as u divided by the norm-squared of u, or u-hat divided by the length of u.
 We will use this shortly to cast our projection and rejection operators into the conventional vector algebra form.
