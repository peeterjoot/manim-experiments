Now we will show that the rejection operator in R^3 can be expressed as a triple cross product.

To find the triple cross product form of the rejection,
 first we enclose the rejection in a grade one selection operator,
 which changes nothing since any vector has only grade-1 components.

Next we expand u-hat wedge v as I times u-hat cross v.

Because the R^3 pseudoscalar commutes with all grades, u-hat I equals I u-hat.

We use the fundamental identity to expand the vector product factors as a dot-product and an I-times cross-product component.

We now have two terms in our grade-1 selection, the first of which is
- a pseudoscalar-scalar product, which is grade-3, so contributes nothing, and
- a scalar-vector product (a vector),
  for which we can drop the enclosing grade-1 selection.

I^2 is just -1

And finally, the anti-commutative property of the cross product can now be used for a final tidy up.

Visualizing this triple cross product form of the rejection requires some uncomfortable right hand contortions.
On the other hand,
 the GA rejection is just a 90 degree rotation and scale, rotating u-hat 90 degrees in the direction of v,
  and scaling that rotated vector by the length-of-v times sine-theta, where theta is the angle between u-hat and v.
