We will now show that the R^3 rejection operator can be expressed as a triple cross product.
+7

To show this,
 first we enclose the rejection in a grade one selection operator.
 This changes nothing since any vector has only grade-1 components.
+11

Next we expand 'u-hat wedge v' as I times 'u-hat cross v'.

Because the R^3 pseudoscalar commutes with all grades, 'u-hat I' equals 'I u-hat'.

We use the fundamental identity to expand the vector product factors as a dot-product and an 'I-times cross-product' component.

We split our grade selection operator into two pieces,
 and then factor out the scalar terms.

The first grade selection filters out the vector components of a pseudoscalar, so is zero.

Our second selection is just the grade-1 components of a vector, so we can drop the enclosing grade selection.

Finally, we tidy up slightly, using the anti-commutative property of the cross product.
