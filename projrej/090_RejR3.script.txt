Now we will show that the rejection operator in R^3 can be expressed as a triple cross product.

To find the triple cross product form of the rejection,
 first we enclose the rejection in a grade one selection operator,
 which changes nothing since any vector has only grade-1 components.

Next we expand u-hat wedge v as I times u-hat cross v.

Because the R^3 pseudoscalar commutes with all grades, u-hat I equals I u-hat.

We use the fundamental identity to expand the vector product factors as a dot-product and an I-times cross-product component.

We split our grade selection operator into two terms, and factor out any scalar terms.

In the first grade-1 selection, we are left selecting the vector component of a pseudoscalar, which is zero.
The second grade-1 selection, contains just a vector, so we can drop the enclosing grade-1 selection.

I^2 is just -1

And finally, the anti-commutative property of the cross product can now be used for a final tidy up.
