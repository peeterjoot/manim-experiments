The projection of v on u and the rejection of u from v are both illustrated in the figure.
# 0:06   +6s.

Algebraically, we can find expressions for these vectors using a standard trick of mathematics,
 multiplying by one, but using a special form of one.
# 0:14:   +8s.

In this case, our special form of one, is u times it's inverse.
# 0:19:   +5s

By switching the order of multiplication, we expand the product of v and u,
 replacing that product with it's dot and wedge components.
# 0:26    +7s

Finally, we distribute the u-inverse.

We can perform the same computation by multiplying v by 1 = u u-inverse on the right.

We've managed to split v into two specific components.
Our claim is that these are the projection of v onto u, and the rejection of u from v.
