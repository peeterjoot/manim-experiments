The projection of v on u and the rejection of u from v are both illustrated in the figure.
# 0:06   +6s.

Algebraically, we can find expressions for these vectors using a standard trick of mathematics,
 multiplying by one, but using a special form of one.
# 0:14:   +8s.

In this case, our special form of one, is u times it's inverse.
# 0:19:   +5s

By switching the order of multiplication, we expand the product of v and u,
 replacing that product with it's dot and wedge components.
# 0:26    +7s

Finally, we distribute the u-inverse.

<TIMING?>
 Note that we can perform the same computation by multiplying v by 1 = u u-inverse on the right.

We've managed to split v into two specific components.
, the first of which, the u-dot-v term,
 lies in the direction of u, since u and u-inverse are parallel (u-inverse is just u divided by it's square.)
</TIMING?>

 On the other hand, the v-wedge-u term lies perpendicular to u,
  since v-wedge-u times u-inverse
  rotates u-inverse by 90 degrees from u towards v.
# 0:49    +23s -- split this up: need more animation here to highlight what is said.

We have blundered upon a decomposition of v, into components that are directed parallel and perpendicular to u.
 These must neccessarily be the components of v that we have labelled the projection and rejection.
