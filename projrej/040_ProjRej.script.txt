This figure shows the projective and rejective split 
 of a vector v (in yellow) with respect a vector u (in red).

The projection of v onto u is in shown in purple,
  and the rejection of u from v is in green.

We will use a standard trick of mathematics to find algebraic expressions for these vector components,
 multiplying by a special form of one.
# 0:14:   +8s.

In this case, our special form of one, is u times it's inverse.
# 0:19:   +5s

We switch the multiplicative grouping, expanding the product of u and v,
 in terms of it's dot and wedge components.
# 0:26    +7s

Finally, we distribute the u-inverse.
 We call the dot product term the projection and the wedge product term the rejection.

We can perform the same computation by multiplying v by 1 = u u-inverse on the right.

...

We've managed to split v into two components two different ways.  
 We must now demonstrate that these satisify our expectations for projection and rejection.
