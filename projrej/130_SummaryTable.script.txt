Here is a summary of the projection and rejection operators in increasing scales of generality.

For the projection operator, the R^3 and R^N forms with u-hats are identical.  

For non-Euclidean spaces, we must write the projection using pairs of u and u-inverse.
  That is required, in particular, for relativistic spaces where vector dot products can be negative.

For the rejection operator, we have a ladder of increasing generality.
 The triple cross product form works only in R^3,
  the bivector-vector product with u-hats works in R^N for any N (including N = 2),
  
The general form of the rejection operator, again using pairs of u and u-inverse, applies to all spaces, 
  including non-Euclidean relativistic spaces used in physics and electromagnetism.
