For the projection operator, the R^3 and R^N forms are identical.  
 The GA form that we found by factoring v as v times u, u-inverse, is slightly more general, as it also
 works for non-Euclidean spaces (i.e. relativistic 4-vectors where the dot product of two vectors can be negative.)

For the rejection operator, we have a ladder of increasing generality.
 The triple cross product form works only in R^3,
  the bivector-vector product with u-hats works in R^N for any N (including N = 2), and finally,
  the most general form, where we write the rejection in terms of u and u-inverse, applies to all spaces, 
  including 4-vector relativistic spaces that we will use in physics and electromagnetism.
