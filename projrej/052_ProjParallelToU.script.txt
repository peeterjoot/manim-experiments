We want to show that what we have claimed to be the projection of v on u, is parallel to u.

We can do so by expanding u-inverse explicitly.

As a side effect, this will show that our GA projection operator is equivalent to 
 the projection operator from traditional vector algebra that we are all used to.

In general the vector inverse has the following form
