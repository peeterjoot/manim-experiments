, the first of which, the u-dot-v term,
 lies in the direction of u, since u and u-inverse are parallel (u-inverse is just u divided by it's square.)
 On the other hand, the v-wedge-u term lies perpendicular to u,
  since v-wedge-u times u-inverse
  rotates u-inverse by 90 degrees from u towards v.
# 0:49    +23s -- split this up: need more animation here to highlight what is said.

We have blundered upon a decomposition of v, into components that are directed parallel and perpendicular to u.
 These must neccessarily be the components of v that we have labelled the projection and rejection.
