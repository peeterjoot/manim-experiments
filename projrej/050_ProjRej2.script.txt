We claim that
 the projection of v onto u is the dot product of v and u, all multiplied by u-inverse,
 and the rejection of u from v is the wedge product of v and u, all multiplied by u-inverse.

For the multivector products in the rejection operator, order matters.
 The left ordering was found by expanding v = v u u-inverse, and the
 right ordering was found by expanding v = u-inverse u v

To substantiate this claim, we need to
