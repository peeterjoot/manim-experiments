In this video, we compute velocity in a radial representation.  We use a scalar radial coordinate, and leave all the angular dependence implicitly encoded in a radial unit vector, r-hat.  We find the geometric algebra structure of the r-hat derivative in two different ways, then derive the conventional triple vector cross product equivalent for reference.

We then compute kinetic energy in this representation, and show how a bivector-valued angular momentum, falls naturally from that computation.

Prerequisites: calculus (derivatives and chain rule), and geometric algebra basics (vector multiplication, commutation relationships for vectors and bivectors in a plane, wedge and cross product equivalencies, ...)
