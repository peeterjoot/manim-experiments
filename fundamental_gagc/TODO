- have (a_1, a_2, ...) as the parameters in some scenes, but u_1, u_2, ... in others.  review and switch to u's.
- 55examples: small transition slide with the hyperbolic parameterization

"x(u,v) = u e_1 + ...

we want to compute

\partial = x^1 \partial_1 + x^2 \partial_2,

but need the reciprocal vectors.  Let's do that in software..."

- new slide: Derivation of all the misc stokes theorem variations.



- refresh all the ~/Movies/ mp4's and clear out the previous suffix versions. (m003 done.)
- summary scene
