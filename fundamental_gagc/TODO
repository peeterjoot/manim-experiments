- then: fundamental theorem of GC : 3 parameter.
   - "derivation" of d^{3-1} x

   skip lots of the details.

- 55examples: small transition slide with the hyperbolic parameterization

"x(u,v) = u e_1 + ...

we want to compute

\partial = x^1 \partial_1 + x^2 \partial_2,

but need the reciprocal vectors.  Let's do that in software..."



- refresh all the ~/Movies/ mp4's and clear out the previous suffix versions. (m003 done.)
- summary scene
- record video and audio for mathematica notebook (logical extension of examples scene)
- have (a_1, a_2, ...) as the parameters in some scenes, but u_1, u_2, ... in others.  review and switch to u's.

- rough audio to get idea of required delays
- add those delays
- script
- final audio and editing
- add outro (mathematica version).  Fixup audio for that (some irksome parts.)
