- working on: fundamental theorem of GC : 1 parameter.
   - need: "derivation" of d^{1-1} x
- then: fundamental theorem of GC : 2 parameter.
   - "derivation" of d^{2-1} x
- then: fundamental theorem of GC : 3 parameter.
   - "derivation" of d^{3-1} x



- refresh all the ~/Movies/ mp4's and clear out the previous suffix versions. (m003 done.)
- summary scene
- record video and audio for mathematica notebook (logical extension of examples scene)
- have (a_1, a_2, ...) as the parameters in some scenes, but u_1, u_2, ... in others.  review and switch to u's.

- rough audio to get idea of required delays
- add those delays
- script
- final audio and editing
- add outro (mathematica version).  Fixup audio for that (some irksome parts.)
