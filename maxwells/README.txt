In this video, we show how to construct a geometric algebra form of Maxwell's equation, and then how to get back the original conventional equations from the integrated Maxwell equation.  We restrict our attention to Maxwell's equations in linear isotopic media.

Prerequisites: geometric algebra basics (vector multiplication, grade selection, vector/bivector products, bivector products and dot products, ...), and calculus (partial differentials, gradient.)
