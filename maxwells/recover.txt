We have assembled the multivector form of Maxwell's equations,
selectively adding and scaling our original equations in ways that may seem suspect.

We should now be able to verify that we haven't lost any information, by extracting
the original curl and divergence relations from our multivector Maxwell's equation.

To do so, we need only apply grade selection operations for each of the grades 0,1,2,3, selecting
the scalar, vector, bivector and trivector grades of the multivector Maxwell's equation, and then showing
how those relate to the original equations.

============================================
Let's start by selecting the scalar grade.

All of the grade selections from the current and charge density multivector (J) are trivial, as we explicitly have one term for each grade.

On the right hand side, the time partials contribute only vector and scalar grades, and Grad I-eta-H has only vector and trivector grades.

This leaves us with eta-c-rho = <Grad E>_0,

or grad dot E = rho over epsilon,

which is Gauss's law.
============================================

For the vector grade selection, we have contributions from dE/dt and Grad I-eta-H

We can commute I and Grad, and then expand Grad H as

Grad dot H plus Grad wedge H

The scalar term does not contribute to the vector grade selection, and we can further expand Grad wedge H as
I times ( Grad \cross H ).

Dividing through by eta leaves us with the Ampere-Maxwell equation.

============================================
For the bivector grade selection, we have contributions d/dt (I-eta-H) and Grad E.

We write out the bivector term of Grad E in dual form, using the cross product,

then multiply through by I, to find the Maxwell-Faraday equation
(with the inclusion of the ficticious magnetic current density.)

============================================

For the trivector grade selection, we only have contributions from the gradient of (I-eta-H).

Again, we can commute Grad and I, and then expand Grad H as Grad-dot plus Grad-wedge.  Only the divergence
portion of that expansion contributes to the overall trivector grade.

We are left with Gauss's law for magnetism.

============================================
Summarizing, we have found Maxwell's equations, in terms of E and H fields, by grade selection.
