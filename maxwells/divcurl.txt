We will be able to group pairs of Maxwell's equations by taking advantage of the geometric product in reverse.

The product of two vectors X, and Y has a dot product and wedge product component.  

We can write the wedge product in dual form, as I times the cross of the two.

Finally, we can let one of these vectors be the gradient, and find that the gradient acting on a vector, has a 
divergence and a dual-curl component.

===========================================

We now take Gauss's law, and the Maxwell-Faraday equation (with Magnetic current density added), and group these 
into a single electric field gradient equation.

Grad E = Div E + I Curl E

To find: Grad E = rho over epsilon -I M - I mu d H/dt.

===========================================

We do the same for Gauss's law for magnetism (with our magnetic charge density contribution), and the Ampere-Maxwell equation, and form

Grad H = Div H + I Curl H

To find: Grad H = rho-m over mu + I J + I epsilon d E /dt.

===========================================

Our electric and magnetic fields have different units (volts/meter and ampere's/meter respectively).  There are two combinations of mu and epsilon that are particularly useful, the first is 

   eta = square-root of mu over epsilon

which has units of Ohms, the dimensions of resistance.  The combination that we will call

   c = 1/ square-root (mu epsilon)

has dimensions of velocity.  We will use eta-H as the re-dimensionalized magnetic field, so that both electric and magnetic fields have units of Volts/Meter.

===========================================

In our electric field gradient equation, we rewrite mu as 

sqrt( mu / epsilon ) times sqrt ( mu epsilon) 

which is eta over c.  We will see that we want to treat the magnetic field as a bivector, so we group together (I eta H) as our magnetic bivector field variable.

===========================================

We proceed to rewrite our Grad H equation in terms of I eta H too.  First multiplying both sides by eta we find an
equation for Grad eta-H, and simplify it.  Then we multiply through by the pseudoscalar I, noting that I commutes with vectors, and are left with an equation for Grad I-eta-H.
