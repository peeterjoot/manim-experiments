We started with Maxwell's equations, augmented with fictitious magnetic charge and current densities.

We introduced a re-dimensionalizing factor eta (with units of Ohms), and a propagation speed constant (c),
and assumed that our matter had isometric properties (the same in all directions), and recast
Maxwell's equations with E,H as the primary fields.

We were able to form linear combinations of Maxwell's equations to show that they can be written as a 
multivector equation, with a multivector current and charge density on one side, and on the other a
space time derivative operator, acting on a combined electro-magnetic field (called the Faraday by some authors.)

We finished off by showing that we were able to recover the original conventional Maxwell's equations by grade
selection.
