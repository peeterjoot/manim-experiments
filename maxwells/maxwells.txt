We now write out our equations for Grad E and Grad I-eta-H with all differential operators on the left.

Our Grad E equation, has only scalar and bivector terms.
Our Grad I-eta-H equation, has only vector and trivector terms.
In both, all terms have units of Volts/meter-squared, so we are free to add these without any loss of information.

Performing that sum, we see that we naturally end up with a total electric and magnetic field multivector:

E plus I-eta-H

and can factor all the differential operators, leaving a hybrid space and time differential operator,
acting on that multivector electromagnetic field.

The action of that space-time gradient (actually a four vector
operator in a relativisic context) is equal to the specific combination of charge and current densities that we see
on the right.

This is Maxwell's equation (singular.)

============================================

We could call it a day, and say that we are done.  However, it is esthetically pleasing to introduce a couple of
helper variables.

We write

F = E + I-eta-H

for the electromagnetic field,

and

J for our multivector current and charge density contributions.

Maxwell's equation is now:

space-time-derivative of F = J.
