Writing out our previous results with all the differential operators on the left hand side, we see that the differential operators all have dimensions of inverse-length.

We have two multivector equations, the first that has Grad E and the time partial of I-eta-H,
and a second with Grad I-eta-H and the time partial of E.

With the units all consistent, we are now in the position where we can simply add these two equations together.

This leaves us with the gradient applied from the left to a multivector electromagnetic field, and
the time partial of the same electromagnetic field.

We can factor all the differential operators, leaving a hybrid space and time differential operator,
applied to the multivector electromagnetic field.  The action of that space-time gradient (actually a four vector 
operator in a relativisic context) is equal to the specific combination of charge and current densities that we see
on the right.

This is Maxwell's equation (singular.)

We could call it a day, and say that we are done.  However, it is esthetically pleasing to introduce a couple of 
helper variables.  

We write 

F = E + I-eta-H

for the electromagnetic field, 

and 

J for our multivector current and charge density contributions.

Maxwell's equation is now:

space-time-derivative of F = J.
