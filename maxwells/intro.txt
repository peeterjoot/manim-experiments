In this video we will figure out a geometric algebra form of Maxwell's equation,
translating from the
Gibbs form of Maxwell's equations, with curls and divergences,
to a multivector form that incorporates all of these into one equation.

+10s
============================

Because they are useful in antenna and microwave engineering, and don't add much additional complexity,
I've included the conventional electric charge density rho and current density J sources,
as well as fictional magnetic magnetic charge density (rho_m) and current density (vector-capital-M) sources.

+10s
============================

We will use E and H as the primary fields, assuming that the
and the electric fields E and D are also related by a scalar (not tensor) proportionality factor epsilon,
and that the magnetic fields B and H related by a scalar (not tensor) proportionality factor mu.

This implies that we are treating the matter containing the fields and charges as isometric,
the same in all directions.

+19s
============================

We are going to make a series of transformations using linear combinations of Maxwell's equations.
We will first group our divs and curls,
to show how we can find a pair of multivector gradient equations, one for each field,
using the geometric product of the gradient and that field.

+13s
============================

We will then scale our magnetic field so that it, like the electric field, has SI units of Volts/meter,
and write it as a bivector I eta H, where eta is the square root of mu/epsilon.

+10s
============================

We will see another constant combination, the reciprocal square root of mu epsilon, occur repeatedly.

We'll label this c.
In a future video, we'll show that c is the speed of propagation of the fields in regions free of sources.

+12s
============================

After this rescaling of the magnetic gradient equation, we'll be able to add our two remaining equations,
and factor out all the differential operators to find Maxwell's equation.

+9s

We've taken Maxwell's equations, a seemingly crazy mix of divs and curls and various signs,
and found a simple underlying structure for it all.

+8s

We will write our combined electric and magnetic field multivector as F, called the Faraday,
and will call the charge and current density multivector J.

+9s

It's tempting to give the spacetime differential operator a special symbol, but I won't do that here.
We will, however,
call it the spacetime-gradient, an entity that happens to have intrinsically relativistic four dimensional structure.

+11s

============================

Applications of this unified form of Maxwell's equations will be left for future videos.
