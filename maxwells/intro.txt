In this video we will translate from the Gibbs form of Maxwell's equations (two curl equations and two divergence equations),
into a multivector geometric algebra formulation of Maxwell's equation (singular.)

============================

We will start with an almost conventional form of Maxwell's equations.
For completeness, fictious magnetic charge density (rho_m) and current density (vector-capital-M) terms,
which have utility in antenna and microwave engineering,
will be included.
We have only to set those to zero to recover the the conventional form of Maxwell's equations in matter.

============================

We will restrict our attention to the special and simplest case of isometric matter.
That is, matter that is the same electrically in all directions.

We model this by assuming that the magnetic fields B and H related by a scalar (not tensor) proportionality factor mu,
and the electric fields E and D are also related by a scalar proportionality factor epsilon.

============================

We will find that Maxwell's equation can be expressed as a spacetime differential operator, acting on a multivector
electromagnetic field F, which results in, or is determined by (depending on what is given), a charge and current density J.

The electromagnetic field F, like the electric field, has units of Volts/Meter.  As the Magnetic field H has units
of Ampere's/Meter, our scaling factor eta, as units of Ohms (resistance.)

The factor c has dimensions of velocity.  C is the speed of light in the medium, but we will not demonstrate that in this video.

============================

After constructing the (singular) form of Maxwell's equation, we will wrap up by showing that we can deconstruct
this equation to find the original divergence and curl equation representations of Maxwell's equations.

============================

Applications of this unified form of Maxwell's equation will be deferred to future videos.
