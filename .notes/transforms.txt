At around 11:06 of your latest video you simultaneously transform a number of terms in various latex objects, without fade-out, in.  How do you do that?

I used several ReplacementTransforms
Probably my most used animation

Is there a way to just move things without drawing in real time?

You could run self.play(a.animate.shift(LEFT)) or something like that
Another option is
b = a.copy()
b.shift(LEFT)
self.play(ReplacementTransform(a, b))
I generally use the second option when doing something more complicated than just moving, though
