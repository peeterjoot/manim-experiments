* In this video, we will use the number line to motivate concepts in vector and geometric algebra, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication.
* The equivalence of the number line to a one dimensional vector space will be illustrated, which will motivate the contraction axiom for the square of a vector in geometric algebra.
* We can conceptualize the plane as a pair of perpendicular number lines, allowing us to map multiplication of numbers to multiplication of perpendicular vectors.
* Multiplication of perpendicular vectors will be seen to have an oriented area representation, and we will see that such a product is order dependent.
* We will return to the contraction axiom of geometric algebra and extract some of the basic identities (e_1^2 = 1, e_1 e_2 = -e_2 e_1, (e_1 e_2)^2 = -1, ...)
* We will show the rotational nature of the 2D pseudoscalar, and note the connection to the complex imaginary.



One of our basic tools for understanding counting and arithmetic is the number line.

This has an origin 
[animate point]

and we may represent any number as a point on the line, with positive numbers to the right
[animate points, 1, 3, 7]

and negative numbers to the left
[animate points, -2, -5, -6]

We add two positive values, say 3, and 5, by moving first to the first point
[animate 3, 5, sum]
and then moving the distance from the origin of the second point from there to the right.

We add two negative values, say -3, and -5, by moving first to the first point
[animate -3, -5, sum]
and then moving the distance from the origin of the second point from there to the left.

In general, if we are adding a positive number, we are moving to the right, regardless of the starting point
[animate -3+5]
[animate -5+3]

and if we are adding a negative number, we are moving to the left
[animate 5-3]
[animate 3-5]
