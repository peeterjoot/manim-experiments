In this video, we demonstrate how to find conic (in particular, elliptical) solution to the Newton's gravitational problem, using our geometric algebra toolbox, understanding how to find the orbits of earth/sun like systems.

We use the unit radial vector derivative and our bivector valued angular momentum that we derived in the last video to do most of the work.

Prerequisites: introductory physics, calculus (derivatives and chain rule), and geometric algebra basics (vector multiplication, grade selection, vector/bivector products, ...)
