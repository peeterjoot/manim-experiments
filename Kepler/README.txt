In this video, we demonstrate how to find an elliptical solution to the Newton's gravitational problem, using our geometric algebra toolbox.
We use the unit radial vector derivative and our bivector valued angular momentum that we derived in the last video to do most of the work.

Prerequisites: introductory physics, calculus (derivatives and chain rule), and geometric algebra basics (vector multiplication, commutation relationships for vectors and bivectors in a plane, wedge and cross product equivalencies, ...)
