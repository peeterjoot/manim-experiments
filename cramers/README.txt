In this video, we use a 2 parameter linear system to show how wedge products can be used to solve exact linear systems.
We see how this relates to Cramer's rule, and see how to generalize the solution method to inexact systems, solving the least squares problem geometrically.
Finally, we use a conventional calculus least squares formulation, and show that this leads to the same solution as the geometric algebra formulation.

Numerical examples are shown using a mathematica notebook that can be found in:

This example uses the GA30 mathematica module available from git@github.com:peeterjoot/gapauli.git

Prerequisites: geometric algebra basics (vector multiplication, grade selection, vector/bivector products, bivector products and dot products, ...), linear algebra (matrix algebra, inversion, ...), and calculus (partial differentials, minimization.)
