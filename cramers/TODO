030:

* Replace: Generally want -> Cannot generally solve.
* Add transformation: ratio -> dot product.
* Replace: equality in first expression.
* Write out c_\perp, and c = c_\parallel + c_\perp

040:

* maybe: switch to illustration that shows c varying, and how c_\perp \wedge b is always perpendicular, but with different size.
* or: illustrate the angle between the cperp-b plane and the a-b plane.
